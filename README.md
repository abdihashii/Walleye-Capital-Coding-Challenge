## Objective

### 1. Functionality

- [x] Enable users to search for recipes by entering their titles
  - Yup, this is completed. A user can go to the homepage, search using the search bar and hit enter to get a recipe, or recipes, that match that search query.
  - \*One important thing to note, the user can only search by `title` for now. Maybe we will add better searching functionality in the future such as the ability to semantic search
- [x] Display a list of recipes that match the search criteria
  - This is now complete. Users can now see all of the recipes on load and then search for recipes that match the search criteria.
- [x] Include as much details about the recipe as appropriate
  - For now, each recipe shows the title, ingredients, and instructions
- [x] Each recipe should include a title, ingredients list, and cooking instructions
- [x] Allow users to view detailed information by clicking on the recipe title
  - User can now click the recipe from the home page and go to a "recipe" page
